# Changelog

All notable changes to this fork (`jerryfane/pilotprotocol`) of
[TeoSlayer/pilotprotocol](https://github.com/TeoSlayer/pilotprotocol) are
documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).
Versions use the upstream tag with a `-jf.N` suffix for fork-local iterations.
Each entry is intended to be upstream-able as a discrete bug fix.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- `beaconKeepaliveLoop` running on an independent 25 s ticker
  (`DefaultBeaconKeepaliveInterval`), separate from the 60 s registry
  heartbeat, so the UDP mapping to the beacon stays alive under consumer
  NAT UDP timeouts (~30-60 s) and relay forwarding remains reachable
  between registry ticks.
- Registry heartbeat can now carry and verify the daemon's current
  registration address. New `registry.Client.HeartbeatWithAddr` plus
  extended signed challenge (`heartbeat:{nodeID}:{addr}`); server-side
  `handleHeartbeat` re-sanitises against the TCP source IP and updates
  `node.RealAddr` if it changed. **Not yet enabled by default** — the
  daemon still calls the plain `Heartbeat` because the upstream public
  registry verifies only the unextended challenge; switch the call site
  once the registry is known to have the matching patch.

### Changed
- `RelayProbeInterval` reduced from 5 min to 60 s so peers marked for
  relay recover quickly after a transient probe failure.
- `handlePacket` now invokes `PortManager.ResetKeepaliveForNode` on every
  successfully routed packet, not just ACK/FIN stream frames. Covers
  datagram, control, and non-ACK stream paths where the peer is
  demonstrably alive but would otherwise have tripped dead-peer detection
  during rekey windows.

### Fixed
- `-public` visibility no longer silently reverts on daemon restart.
  `pilotctl set-public` / `set-private` and the `-public` launch flag now
  persist to `~/.pilot/config.json` via a new `writeConfigKey` helper in
  `cmd/pilotctl/main.go`; daemon start reads the persisted value as a
  fallback when the flag isn't explicitly passed.

## [v1.7.2-jf.2] - 2026-04-18

### Fixed
- Encrypted tunnel flap every ~5 min at `NetworkSync` rekey boundaries.
  `TunnelManager` now exposes `SetRekeyCallback`; the daemon installs
  `PortManager.ResetKeepaliveForNode` at startup, and both rekey branches
  (`handleEncryptedKeyExchange`, `handleKeyExchange`) call
  `tm.notifyRekey(peerNodeID)` after `flushPending` when `keyChanged` is
  true. The helper clears `KeepaliveUnacked` and refreshes `LastActivity`
  on every `StateEstablished` connection routed over the rekeying peer so
  in-flight ACKs dropped during the key swap don't trip dead-peer
  detection.
- Files: `pkg/daemon/ports.go`, `pkg/daemon/tunnel.go`,
  `pkg/daemon/daemon.go`.

## [v1.7.2-jf.1] - 2026-04-18

Commit `2d4e657` on `main`.

### Fixed
- NAT hole-punch packets sent to non-routable targets. `handlePunchCommand`
  in `pkg/daemon/tunnel.go` now drops punches to RFC1918, loopback,
  link-local, and unspecified addresses before writing to the UDP socket
  (mirroring the existing `isPrivateAddr` filter used for STUN results),
  logging `skipping NAT punch to non-routable target` at WARN. Daemon
  falls through to the existing relay-fallback path.
